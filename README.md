# A Comprehensive Study of Different Deep Neural Network Architectures for Traffic Sign Classification

This project presents a comparative analysis of
six neural network architectures: AlexNet, DenseNet, ResNet50,
ResNet101, VGGNet, and a custom CNN model, for traffic
sign classification. The primary objective is to identify the
architecture that achieves the highest accuracy in this task.
Extensive experimentation and evaluation are conducted using
a dataset of traffic sign images. The results reveal valuable
insights into the performance of each architecture. ResNet50
and ResNet101 exhibit exceptional accuracy due to their deep
and residual network structures. VGGNet and AlexNet achieve
high accuracies by leveraging different convolutional layers and
pooling operations. The custom CNN model also demonstrates
promising results. This comparative analysis provides valuable
knowledge about the capabilities and limitations of various neural
network architectures for traffic sign classification. By identifying
the architecture that achieves the highest accuracy, this study
informs the optimization and selection of models for intelligent
transportation systems. Enhanced traffic sign classification can
significantly improve the efficiency and safety of automated
driving systems.
